## About The Project

This project was developed as a graduation project, which is the last stage of the SoftITo front end developer course, which is an establishment of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.

## Built With

While developing this project, there were some libraries that I used and some packages that I benefited from. These; I used React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwinds CSS, React-router, React-use, Headless UI, Indiana drag scroll and finally the "nekoCalc" website to convert the pixel units on the Spotify page to "rem" while working on Tailwind.
